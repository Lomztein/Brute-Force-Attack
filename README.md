# Brute Force Attack

Brute Force Attack (Project codename: Project Virus) is a Tower Defence game developed mainly by Marcus "Lomztein" Jensen, with help and feedback from various freinds. It is made using the Unity Engine, Personal Edition and uses a bunch of image effects related standard assets, most notably the Bloom effect, but also the depth of field effect visible in the main menu.

The game is build around a more or less standard Tower Defence core, but is has attempted to innovate by applying more modern Real Time Strategy elements to the formula. Most notably is the concept of the research tree, which controls the progression of the game, stopping the player from simply saving up to the most powerful weapons early on, and instead building a variety of weapons untill the most powerful are within the players grasp. Another attempted innovation is the concept of the modular turret system, in which a single turret is made out of a bunch of modules, most commonly a base, a rotator and a weapon. However, due to poor planning and game design, as well as less-than-well structured programming, this became little more than a neat side-feature with no real practical uses outside of more compact damage.

One of the other notable features of this game is the mass enemy spam. Within a the first 30 waves, the game will spit out more enemies than most computers can handle dispite heavy optimization efforts. While the framerate might tank, all enemy and turret logic is written to be framerate independant, and therefore will play out as it should, dispite the framerates reaching something not too dissimilar to a particularily slow power point presentation. Due to the simple graphics of this game, future improvements in CPU technoligy might remidy this.

This game has been declared complete on the seventh of december, 2017. (07-12-2017), and so it is the first ever larger-scale complete project in my (Lomztein's) personal portfolio. Perhaps with this mess of spaghetticode and bloom I might be able to land a decent job.

Any bug reports, feedback or constructive critisism should be directed to lomztein4@gmail.com or given in person. Alternatively, bug reports may be posted in the issues section of this repository.

# Known Issues:

 * In the assembly editor, placing down two base modules will have the game "focus" on the second one. Deleting the second one does not revert this.
