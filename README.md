# Brute Force Attack

Brute Force Attack (Project codename: Project Virus) is a Tower Defence game developed mainly by Marcus "Lomztein" Jensen, with help and feedback from various freinds. It is made using the Unity Engine, Personal Edition and uses a bunch of image effects related standard assets, most notably the Bloom effect, but also the depth of field effect visible in the main menu.

The game is build around a more or less standard Tower Defence core, but is leaning heavily towards trying to allow the player to customize his own turret "assemblies" through a modular turrets system and an in-game research menu. On top of this, the enemies update code is relatively fast and optimized, as well as various techniques being used for optimization, mostly object pooling, but also a lot, and I mean a lot of baking of information during the "Initializng" phase right before a wave.

Spritework is also made by Lomztein, mostly using GameMaker even though much better alternatives exists. This is due to simply being used to the GameMaker interface and no real need for more advanced spritework than what GameMaker allows for.

Development of the game has happened on and off for many months, but an estimate is that it would take about 1-2 months to develop from start untill finish if worked on full time. It is planned to be released soon, and only few bug fixes and polishment remains before it is ready for the public to play.
